  transition: 0.5s;
transition-timing-function: ease-in; - decides the speed effect of the transition

ease-starts slow speed up in middle and end slow
ease-in - starts slow and speed up
ease-out
step- step by step transition
linear- uniform speed
cubic-bezier(x,y,z,a)-custom speed allocation like cubic-bezier(.2,.3,.5,.1)
